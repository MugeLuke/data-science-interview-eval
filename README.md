As part of this Data Science exercise challenge, the Holman Data Science Team would like you to create a sample application in either Python or R that will analyze the [part pricing data for Ford F150 tire repairs](./data/f150-tire-repairs.parquet).

As part of your analysis, you are free to create a stand-alone application or a Jupyter notebook.

You are free to use any available package and graphing tool you are familiar with to illustrate your reasoning.

The evaluation is to be completed in 7 days or less, and will be reviewed via a Zoom meeting with stakeholders

## Instructions
1. Create a new branch off `master`
2. Use the provided [Ford F150 tire repair](./data-f150-tire-repairs.parquet) data to evaluate the pricing information.
3. Use either Python or R to evaluate the data as either a stand-alone application or Jypter Notebook.
4. Illustrate the Mean, Standard Deviation, and Median of the data set.
5. Find which prices are outliers and how you determined them to be so.
6. Determine what should be the expected Ford F150 tire repair part price.
7. Log the output in whatever fashion you like.
8. Push commits to the repo as work is completed to illustrate your train of thought.
9. When finished create a pull request into the `master` branch.
